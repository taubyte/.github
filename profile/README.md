At **Taubyte** we are at the forefront of the cloud creation movement. Our tools, platforms, and methodologies are crafted keeping developers at the core, simplifying the process of constructing your very own cloud infrastructure.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, and with our unwavering commitment to WebAssembly (WASM), we're paving the way for developers to architect an expansive, interoperable cloud ecosystem that spans everything from CDNs and 5G to AI capabilities. We're ushering in a future where every developer has the autonomy and tools to build their unique cloud space.

## ðŸ”® Vision

In the next 5-10 years, here's where we see ourselves and the cloud industry:

- **WebAssembly Revolution**: We're placing WebAssembly at the core of cloud creation. With WASM, we envision cloud applications that are faster, more secure, and effortlessly portable across platforms.

- **GitOps Empowerment**: Infrastructure as code is more than just a buzzword for us. Our platforms streamline infrastructure deployment, ensuring it's auditable, automated, and replicable, all with the power of Git.

- **Community & Collaboration**: At our core, we're community-driven. We're striving to create a space devoid of vendor lock-ins, where developers can experiment, collaborate, and innovate without restrictions.

- **Unlocking Potential**: The vast computational resources of our world largely remain untapped. We're on a mission to change that. With our tools, transform idle computational power into efficient, scalable cloud infrastructures.

- **Craft Your Cloud**: Our primary mission is to put cloud creation in the hands of developers. Consider us your toolkit, always at your side as you venture into the cloud.
